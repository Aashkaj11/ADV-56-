    <hr>
    <p id="p1">1.The Sun is all the colours mixed together, this appears white to our eyes.<br>2.It is a main-sequence G2V star (or Yellow Dwarf).<br>3. At its centre the Sun reaches temperatures of 15 million °C.<br>4.It is 4.6 billion years old.<br>5.It is mostly composed of hydrogen (70%) and Helium (28%). <br>6. It accounts for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System.<br>7.The atmosphere of the Sun is composed of three areas: the photosphere, chromosphere, and solar corona.</p>

    <hr>

    <p id="p2">1.Mercury is the closest planet to our Sun
        and is the smallest planet in our solar system.<br>2.It is so close to the sun, it is hard to directly observe it from Earth except during dawn or twilight.<br>3.It is named after the ancient Roman god of trade and profit.<br>4.It is the Planet with the Most Extreme Temperature Fluctuations in the Solar System.<br>5.Even though Mercury is the closest planet to the sun, its surface can still be extremely cold. The temperature during the day can reach 840 degrees Fahrenheit (450 degrees Celsius), but at night, temperatures can get as low as minus 275 F (minus 170 C). That fluctuation equals a temperature swing of more than 1,100 F (600 C), the largest of any planet in the solar system.<br>6.Mercury’s core has more iron in it than any other planet’s in the solar system.
        <br>7.Mercury Orbits the Sun Faster than Any Other Planet. On average Mercury takes only 88 days to complete its orbit, traveling at a speed of 112,000 miles (180,000 km/h) per hour.

    <h2>Venus</h2>
    <img id="4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pNX8eVGowB6WT8tyrTMufk-1200-80.jpg">
    <hr>
    <p id="p3"> 1.Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of size and mass. It is only slightly smaller than Earth, with it’s diameter being 95% that of our planet,
        because of this, we sometimes refer to Venus as our sister planet.<br>2.If we are looking at Venus, then it’s color appears to us as light yellow and white. Looking at Venus from space, it’s white, as it is covered by clouds. However, we’re not 100% sure what the color is on the surface.<br>3.A full year on Venus is equal to 225 days on Earth.
        However, just one DAY on Venus is equal to 243 Earth days, so one day is longer than one year! This is because Venus rotates very, very slowly.<br>4.Unlike most of the other planets, Venus actually rotates in the opposite direction. We think this is likely due to the gravitational pull from the Sun.<br>5.Venus travels around the Sun at a speed of 78,341 miles (126,077km) per hour.<br>6.The surface gravity on Venus is actually very similar to Earth, at roughly 90% of our gravity. This means that a 200lb man would weigh approximately 180lbs on Venus.<br>7.The atmosphere on Venus is actually the reason why it’s so hot. The thick atmosphere, made primarily from Carbon Dioxide, traps the heat from the Sun so the surface of Venus is extremely hot.

    <p id="p4">1.The Earth is around 4.6 billion years old according to scientists.<br>2.The Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System.<br>3. Earth’s atmosphere divided in 5 sections from the surface: Troposphere (0-13 km), Ozone Layer (13-25 km), Stratosphere (25-50 km), Mesosphere (50-75 km), and Thermosphere (75-150 km).<br>4.Earth is composed of: iron (32%), oxygen (30%), silicon (15%), magnesium (14%), sulfur (3%), nickel (2%), calcium (1.5%), aluminum (1.4%) and the remainder made up of other elements.<br>5.Earths main tectonic plates: African plate, Antarctic plate, Indo-Australian Plate, Eurasian Plate, North American Plate, South American Plate, and the Pacific Plate.<br>6. Earth has several layers with unique chemical and seismic properties: Crust (0-40 km), upper mantle (40-400 km), transition region (400-650 km), lower mantle (650-2700 km), D layer (2700-2890 km), outer core (2890-5150 km), and the inner core (5150-6378 km) from the surface.<br>7. Earth’s distance from the Sun – Min. 146 million km (91million miles) Max. 152 million km (94.5 million miles).</p>

    <h2>Jupiter</h2><img id="7" src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.KzLv0RY9J4nP6IA6CiNimgHaHa?pid=Api&rs=1">
    <hr>
    <p id="p6">.The mass of Jupiter is 1,898,130,000,000,000,000 billion kg, which is 317.83 times the mass of Earth.<br>2.Jupiter is so massive that its total mass is twice as much as the mass of all planets in Solar System combined together. Jupiter is capable of holding 1300 Earths in it.<br>3.With a radius of 43,440.7 miles (69,911 kilometers), Jupiter is 11 times wider than Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Jupiter would be about as big as a basketball.<br>4.Being the largest planet in our solar system, Jupiter was rightly named after the king of all gods in Roman Mythology. The Romans called this planet Jupiter because it was the largest object in the sky.<br>5.If a person could stand on the clouds at the top of Jupiter’s atmosphere, the force of gravity he or she would feel would be about 2.4 times the force of gravity on the surface of Earth.
        <br>6.Jupiter is also nicknamed “vacuum cleaner of the solar system” because of its ability to attract other heavenly bodies into it due to its sheer mass and strong magnetic field.<br>7.Deep under Jupiter’s clouds is a huge ocean of liquid metallic hydrogen. On Earth, hydrogen is usually gas. But on Jupiter, the pressure is so great inside its atmosphere that the gas becomes liquid.

    <h2>Saturn</h2><img id="8" src="http://www.zastavki.com/pictures/originals/2015/Space_The_planet_Saturn_in_the_sky_093724_.jpg">
    <hr>
    <p id="p7">1.Saturn is 74,898 miles (120,537 km.) wide, nearly 10 times wider than Earth. Approximately 750 Earths could fit inside of Saturn.<br>2.Saturn is a slightly smaller version of Jupiter, with similar, but less distinctive, surface patterns. Like Jupiter, it is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium gas. Saturn’s main difference to Jupiter is the amazing set of rings that orbit it.<br>3.Saturn’s rings are made up of bits of ice, dust and rock. Some of these bits are as small as grains of sand. Some are much larger than tall buildings. Some are up to a kilometer (more than half-a-mile) across.<br>4.It is named after the Roman god Saturnus and was known to the Greeks as Cronus.<br>5.Storms on Saturn can last for months or even years. A long-lived 2004 storm on Saturn, named the “Dragon Storm,” created mega-lightning 1,000 times more powerful than lightning on Earth.<br>6.The magnetic field of Saturn is nearly 578 times as powerful as that of the Earth.<br>7.Titan, another of Saturn’s moon is the only moon to have a substantial atmosphere. Its atmosphere is 370 miles deep.</p>

    <h2>Uranus</h2><img id="9" src=https://5factum.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/10-Interesting-Facts-About-Planet-Uranus-5Factum-1024x678.jpg.webp>
    <hr>
    <p id="8">1.Uranus is the coldest planet in the Solar System <br>2. Planet Uranus was officially discovered by Sir William Herschel in 1781. It is too dark for the ancients to have seen. At first, Herschel assumed it was a comet, but it was confirmed as a planet many years later. Herschel sought to have his discovery named “Georgian Sidus” after King George III. Astronomer Johann Bode proposed the name Uranus. The name originates from Ouranos, the ancient Greek god.<br>3. Planet Uranus currently has 13 identified rings. All but two Uranians are extremely small-only a few kilometers long. The rings are believed to be relatively young. The matter in the rings is believed to be pieces of a moon or planets separated by high-speed collisions with an object like a comet or an asteroid.<br>4. The two ice giants found in the outer solar system are Uranus and Neptune. Around 80 percent of Planet Uranus’ mass consists of thick, hot fluid of “cold” materials like water, methane, and ammonia. These are above a rocky core, with temperatures of 9,000 degrees F/4,892 degrees C near the core.It is assumed that the inside of Planet Uranus comprises two layers, which are the core and a mantle. Scientists believe the heart consists mainly of rock and ice, and the mantle is about 13.3 times the Earth’s density and is made up of water, ammonia, and other elements.<br>5. Just one spacecraft was ever to reach Planet Uranus. In January 1986, NASA’s Voyager 2 passed Uranus. Before starting its path towards Neptune, it managed to take thousands of photographs of Uranus and his Moons. No other spacecraft has been sent out to Uranus, and there are no plans to explore this planet as of the beginning of 2013 for any future spacecraft.<br>6. Uranus’s rings were the first to be seen after those of Saturn. They were a big discovery as it made astronomers realize that rings are a common characteristic of planets, not just Saturn’s peculiarity. Planet Uranus has two sets of rings around it. The inner ring system consists mainly of small, dark circles, while an outer network of two more distant circles is brightly colored, as discovered by the Hubble Space Telescope: one red, one blue. 13 Known rings around Uranus have been identified by scientists.</p>

        1. Neptune Was Discovered Later Than Most Planets
        While most of the planets closer to Earth were discovered in the early years, that was truly possible because the other planets are closer to us as well as pretty large in size. In 1846, Jean Verrier was able to identify its presence correctly.<br>2. Neptune Was Originally Called La Verrier
        Since Jean Verrier discovered the planet, the initial name that it was given was after him. However, it was decided that it should be named after a Roman God just like the other planets. The name that was chosen was Neptune since it’s referred to its blue colour, that is in line with the Roman God of oceans.<br>3. Uranus Is the Reason Why Neptune Could Be Discovered
        Neptune is a planet that’s quite far away, so its presence couldn’t be determined easily. However, Uranus was visible and there was a peculiar orbital behaviour in it that was noticeable. That led to the belief that another body might be pulling it by its gravity, which helped in discovering Neptune<br>4. A Year on Neptune Would Equal Nearly 60,000 Days on Earth
        Yes, Neptune is the slowest planet to complete its revolution around the sun. By the time the Earth completes 165 revolutions, Neptune ends up completing one. After being discovered in 1846, Neptune completed its first revolution in 2011<br>5. Neptune Does Not Have a Surface
        Did you know that you won’t be able to stand on Neptune at all? That’s because there’s no solid surface. Neptune is fully made of gas, making it one of the gas giants of your solar system. It just has an inner layer of ice made up of water and a few other gases.<br>6. Earth Is as Small as Neptune’s Core
        Neptune is truly a giant. The solid core at the centre of Neptune is roughly equal to the size of Earth. And just like Jupiter, Neptune has its own storm circling around it as well. That storm is a big black spot on the surface, which itself is slightly larger than Earth.<br>7. A Day on Neptune Is Just 18 Hours Long
        Remember how we mentioned above that a year on Neptune is equal to 165 years on Earth? Surprisingly, a day on Neptune is quite shorter than ours. This is because Neptune rotates at a speed higher than that of Earth, making its day 6 hours shorter than ours.</p>
